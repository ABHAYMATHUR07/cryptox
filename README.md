This project implements a text and file encryption/decryption utility with a focus on both security and 
usability. The tool supports multiple encryption algorithms—including AES, DES, RSA, and Blowfish—
 enabling users to choose a suitable method based on their needs. 
Built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface, the application is designed to be accessible 
for both technical and non-technical users. It allows encryption and decryption of both text input and files, 
offering features like key generation, encryption mode selection, and clipboard integration to enhance 
usability. 
The core objective of the project is to provide a practical, secure solution for protecting sensitive data during 
storage and transmission, while maintaining a simple and intuitive user experience.
